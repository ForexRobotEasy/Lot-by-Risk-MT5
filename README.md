# Lot by Risk MT5

## Description

This code represents a user-friendly interface for placing orders in MetaTrader 5 (MT5) using a trading panel. The purpose of this code is to provide traders with an efficient and convenient way to manage their trades by allowing them to easily set take profit, stop loss, and price levels for their orders.

The code utilizes hot keys to control the order placement process. When a specific key is pressed, the code checks the input and executes the corresponding action. For example, pressing the 'T' key sets the take profit level, pressing the 'P' key sets the price level, and pressing the 'S' key sets the stop loss level.

The volume of each order is calculated based on the trader's desired risk percentage. The code retrieves the account equity and stop loss value to calculate the appropriate order volume. This ensures that the trader's risk is controlled and managed effectively.

The code also includes functions to customize the hot keys in the trading panel settings, provide traders with a clear understanding of the potential risk associated with their trades, and handle the logical conclusion of the program.
